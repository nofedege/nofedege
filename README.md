Hi! I'm Sophia ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computational biologist with a Ph.D. focused on molecular oncology and transcriptomics. I spend most of my time wrangling genomic data in R, mining multi-omic datasets, and running RNA-seq analyses to understand cancer biology.
My recent work has involved using biostatistical models to predict regions involved in melanoma drug resistance, then validating those predictions in human cell culture. I love diving into complex datasets to find the biological stories hidden in the data.
I've been fortunate to receive support from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and an NIH Training Grant, and have shared my research at conferences worldwide. My background includes research experiences at Cleveland Clinic and Washington University School of Medicine.
When I'm not coding or in the lab, you might find me switching between English and German (native in both)!
