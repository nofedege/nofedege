- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophia @nofedege
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Ph.D. with a focus in computational biology, expertise in molecular oncology and transcriptomics.
Experience using R for genomic data processing, mining public multi-omic datasets and processing
generated RNA-seq analysis. I've used biostatistical modeling to predict regions of interest for
melanoma drug resistance and validated these predicted regions in human cell culture. I have substantial
experience presenting data and communicating results at international and national conferences.
Supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program and an NIH Training Grant. Past
research experience includes the Cleveland Clinic and the Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis. Bilingual native proficiency in German and English.
